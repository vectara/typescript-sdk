     * Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned after the reranking process. When a reranker is applied, it performs the following steps:
     * 1. Reranks all input results according to its algorithm.
     * 2. Sorts the reranked results based on their new scores.
     * 3. Returns the top N results, where N is the value specified by this limit.
     * Note: This limit is applied per reranking stage. In a chain of rerankers, each reranker can have its own limit, potentially reducing the number of results at each stage.
